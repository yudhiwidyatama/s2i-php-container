    <h1>The SAPU16 Library</h1>

    <ol>
    <h2><li>General Information</h2>

    The SAPU16 Library provides functions for character processing using
    16-bit Unicode. They replace the corresponding wchar_t functions of
    the C runtime.  The functions which are provided by the SAPU16 library
    are declared in sapu16.h .
    For UTF-16 and other Unicode encoding forms, see the Appendix.

    <p>
      The SAPU16 Library is Open Source. For the terms and conditions, please
      refer to the file README.
      The README file also contains information how to compile and install
      the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The version number of the SAPU16 Library can be found in u16_aux.c,
      see the variable version_u16.

    <h2><li><a name="ErrorHandling">Error Handling and Trace Messages</a>  </h2>                                     
    <p>
      By default, the SAPU16 Library writes error and trace messages to stderr.
      You  can redirect or
      suppress the
      messages.
      To redirect the messages,
      implement a function with the same signature as in the following example:</p>                                     
    <blockquote>                                     
  <pre>static void print_trace ( const utf16_t * buffer,
                          int number_of_chars )
{
   fwriteU16 ( buffer, number_of_chars, 1, trace_file );
   fputcU16  ( cU('\n') , trace_file );
}</pre>                                     
</blockquote>                                     
<p>Further,  call the following function</p> 
<blockquote>                                     
  <pre>setTraceLibu16U16 ( print_trace, high );</pre> 
</blockquote>                                     
<p>which will store the function pointer in a global variable.<br> 
The message handling function (here <code>print_trace</code>) may use 
<code>fwriteU16</code> and <code>fputcU16</code>, 
but it should avoid any U16-functions which themselves might issue another message                                      
since there is the danger of infinite recursion. 
</p>                                     
<p>The second parameter of <code>setTraceLibu16U16()</code> determines whether warnings are                                      
reported too, see below.                                    

</p>                                     
<h4>Typical Error Conditions:</h4>                                    
<p>If a conversion from UTF-8 (e.g. used in files) to UTF-16 fails:</p>                                     
<ol>                                   
  <li>A trace                                      
message is written, including a dump.</li>                                   
  <li>errno is set to EILSEQ.</li>                                   
  <li>The function returns the usual value for unsuccessful completion.</li>                                   
</ol>                                   
<p>malloc() is used in very exceptional cases only. If a malloc() fails:</p>                                     
<ol>                                   
  <li>A trace message is written.</li>                                   
  <li>errno is set to                                      
ENOMEM.</li>                                   
  <li>The function returns the usual value for unsuccessful completion.</li>                                   
</ol>                                   
<h4>Trace Levels:</h4>

</blockquote>           
<p>The following two functions are not available on NT, and their non-Unicode 
(char-type)

ASCII. Otherwise, only <code>'.'</code> is accepted as decimal point.
Grouping (e.g. 1,000,000.00) is not supported.
Hexadecimal numbers are not accepted.</p>

<h2><li><a name="FmtInput">Formatted Input</a></h2> 
<p>In the following, some Unicode specific details are described. These have to                                      
be understood as an extension of the documentation of the original char-type functions.</p>                                     
<p>When reading from files or stdin, the U16 versions of standard I/0 functions                                      
expect UTF-8 and convert the input to 16-bit Unicode. If any standard I/O                                      
function encounters an invalid UTF-8 character in the input stream, it replaces 
it with a '#' character tries to continue reading.&nbsp; Please check <code>errno</code>. For                                      
an invalid UTF-8 character, <code>errno</code> is set to EILSEQ.
This is in line with the function <code>fgetwc</code> of C99. </p> 

<p> The functions <code>fget_strU16</code> and <code>fget_lineU16</code> offer a 
different error handling, see below.

<h3>Deprecated: scanf and fscanf:</h3>                                   
<blockquote>                       
<pre>int  scanfU16(               const utf16_t *format, ... );
int fscanfU16( FILE *stream, const utf16_t *format, ... );</pre> 
</blockquote>                       
<p>These functions are similar to <code>sscanfU16</code>, but read
from a file which implies some differences.
These functions have severe shortcomings, so we recommend to use
<code>fget_strU16</code> to read strings that are delimited by 
whitespace characters, or to use
<code>fget_intU16</code>, <code>fget_longU16</code>
to read decimal integers, 
or to read an entire line with <code>fget_lineU16</code>
and to apply  <code>sscanfU16()</code> afterwards.
</p>    
<p>The input of <code>scanfU16</code> and <code>fscanfU16</code>
is expected to be UTF-8. 
If the input stream contains a byte sequence that is not a valid UTF-8 
character, the functions 
set <code>errno</code> to EILSEQ and try to continuae reading.
If they encounter
a UTF-8 character with more than 3 bytes, they replace it with
0xfffd (Unicode replacement character).
</p>                                    
<p>Attention: Calling <code>ungetc</code> after scanfU16 or fscanfU16 may fail (since (f)scanfU16                                     
may have done an ungetc internally and some existing operating systems guarantee just                                     
one character of push back.)</p>                                    

<p>If the last character read from the input stream does not match, it
should be pushed back, but this may fail because <code>ungetc()</code>
(on some operating systems) guarantees only one byte of push back.
Also, we do not employ UTF-8 locales. Some platforms do not have 
UTF-8 locales.  So, the non-matching character is pushed back only
if it is in the 7-bit ASCII range. (In this case the UTF-8
representation is a single byte < 0x80.) Otherwise this
non-matching character is discarded.
</p>                                    

<h4>Return Value:</h4>                                   
<p>Number of successfully matched and assigned input items. This number can be                                    
0. If the function cannot continue reading the input and no conflict or                                    
assignment occured so far, the function returns EOF.</p>

s may be a null pointer. The return value is the number of 16-bit units that would                                     
have been written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating                                     
null character, or a negative value if an error occurred. Thus, the                                     
null-terminated output has been completely written if and only if the returned                                     
value is nonnegative and less than n. (This conforms to the C99 standard.) The                                     
<code>%n</code> format specifier takes a pointer to a signed integer into which is written                                     
the number of 16-bit units that would have been written so far if n had been                                     
sufficiently large.</p>                                    
<p>The behaviour of the char-type functions <code>snprintf</code> and <code>vsnprintf</code> may be                                     
different and may depend on the release of the operating system; on some

<h3>fget_strU16:</h3>                                   
<blockquote>                 
<pre>int fget_strU16( utf16_t *s, int n, FILE *stream, utf16_t repl_char );</pre> 
</blockquote>                 

<p>
<code>fget_strU16</code> reads a string that is delimited by
whitespace characters.  Leading whitespace characters are skipped.
<code>fget_strU16</code> reads non-whitespace characters from
<code>stream</code> until a whitespace character occurs, which is not
pushed back, or EOF occurs.  At most <code>n-1</code> non-whitespace
characters are read and stored in <code>s</code>. If the input stream
contains a byte sequence that is not a valid UTF-8 character, the
function replaces each invalid byte with the replacement character
<code>repl_char</code> and tries to continue reading.  A terminating <code>'\0'</code> is
appended to <code>s</code> unless an error occurred before reading
anything into <code>s</code> or <code>n=0</code>.  </p>

<h4>Return value:</h4>  
                                
<p>If successful, <code>fget_strU16</code> returns the
number of non-whitespace characters read. If it was not possible to
read any non-whitespace characters or an error (as indicated by the
ferror function) occurred, <code>fget_strU16</code> returns
EOF. Otherwise, if any input was replaced with <code>repl_char</code>,
<code>fget_strU16</code> returns -2. </p>

<h4>Remark:</h4>  

<p><b>Whitespace characters</b> include '&nbsp;' (space), 
'\t' (horizontal tabulation),
'\n' (newline), '\v' (vertical tabulation), '\f' (form feed), '\r' 
(carriage return), '\u3000' (fullwidth ideographic space)  and some others. 
</p>

<pre>int fget_lineU16( utf16_t *s, int n, FILE *stream, utf16_t repl_char );</pre> 
</blockquote>                 

<p><code>fget_lineU16</code> is similar to <code>fgetsU16</code>, but
has a different error handling and different return codes.
<code>fget_lineU16</code> reads at most <code>n-1</code> characters
into <code>s</code> and adds a terminating <code>'\0'</code>. It stops
reading after <code>'\n'</code> has been read and stored. It also
stops when EOF occurs.  If EOF is encountered and no characters have
been read into <code>s</code>, the contents of <code>s</code> remain
unchanged.  If the input stream contains a byte sequence that is not a
valid UTF-8 character, the function replaces each invalid byte with
the replacement character <code>repl_char</code> and tries to continue
reading.
 </p>

<h4>Return value:</h4>  
                                
<p>If successful, <code>fget_lineU16</code> returns the number of
characters read, including any <code>'\n'</code>, but not including
the terminating <code>'\0'</code>. If it was not possible to read
anything or an error (as indicated by the <code>ferror</code>
function) occurred, <code>fget_lineU16</code> returns EOF. Otherwise,
if any input was replaced with <code>repl_char</code>,
<code>fget_lineU16</code> returns -2.

<pre>int fget_longU16( long int* ptr, FILE *stream );</pre> 
</blockquote>                 

<p><code>fget_longU16</code> reads a decimal integer from stream,
converts it to the type <code>long int</code> and stores it in the
address pointed to by <code>ptr</code>. <code>fget_longU16</code>
skips leading whitespace characters.  <code>fget_longU16</code>
accepts the digits '0' to '9', preceeded by an optional sign ('+' or
'-').
 </p>

<h4>Return value:</h4>  
                                
<p>If successful, <code>fget_longU16</code> returns 0.  If it was not
possible to read any non-whitespace character or an error (as
indicated by the <code>ferror</code> function) occurred,
<code>fget_longU16</code> returns EOF. If the input stream contained a
byte sequence that is not a valid UTF-8 character,
<code>fget_longU16</code> sets <code>errno</code> to EILSEQ and
returns EOF.  If an overflow or underflow occurred,
<code>LONG_MAX</code> or <code>LONG_MIN</code> is stored in the
address pointed to by <code>ptr</code> and 1 is returned. If none of
the previous errors occurred, but there was no digit in the stream,
<code>fget_longU16</code> returns -2; in this case the non-digit
character read is not pushed back to the stream, but its value is cast
to the type <code>long int</code> and stored in the address pointed to
by <code>ptr</code>.

<p><code>fget_intU16</code> reads a decimal integer from
<code>stream</code>, converts it to the type <code>int</code> and
stores it in the address pointed to by <code>ptr</code>. The behaviour
is analoguous to <code>fget_longU16</code>.

<h2>Appendix: Unicode Encoding Forms </h2>                                   
<i>Partially based on the Unicode FAQ Copyright ©1998-2000 Unicode, Inc.</i>

    <p>For Unicode, there are three main encoding forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and
      UTF-32), which encode the same common character repertoire.
      Transformations between these encoding forms are efficient and do not
      lead to any loss of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      UTF-16 allows access to nearly 63500 characters as single Unicode
16-bit units. It can access one million additional characters by a
mechanism known as surrogate pairs. Two ranges of Unicode code values
are reserved for the high (first) and low (second) values of these
pairs. Highs are from 0xD800 to 0xDBFF, and lows from 0xDC00 to
0xDFFF.  Since the most common characters have already been encoded as
16-bit values, the characters requiring surrogate pairs will be
relatively rare.
    </p>
    <p>
All characters represented in UTF-16, including those represented with
a surrogate pair, can be represented as a single 32-bit unit in
UTF-32. This single unit corresponds to the Unicode scalar value,
which is the abstract number associated with a Unicode
character. UTF-32 is a subset of the encoding called UCS-4 in ISO
10646.
    </p>
    <p>
In UTF-8, the representation of each character requires between one
and four 8-bit units. For 7-bit ASCII characters, the UTF-8 encoding
coincides with the ASCII encoding.
    </p>
    <p>
The UCS-2 encoding is a subset of UTF-16; it uses 16 bits for each
character.
